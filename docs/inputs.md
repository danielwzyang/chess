Move inputs will follow a very simplified algebraic notation. 
The first character is the piece that you want to move, with pawn being implicit. 
The next two characters should be the position that you want to move to. 
Some example moves are: d4, Nf3, Bc4, Qh1, and Ke2. 

For disambiguation and promotion, just type the move in the format described above and a follow-up question will be asked.
For disambiguation, it will ask for the position of the piece you want to move. 
For promotion, it will ask what piece you want to promote to.

If you want castle, type 0-0 for kingside castling and 0-0-0 for queenside castling.
